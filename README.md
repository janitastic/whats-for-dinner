# What's for Dinner?

The most annoying question in every household is always "what's for dinner?". We've made that question easy to answer with the **What's for Dinner?** app!

## Overview

Our app includes 10 varieties of sides, 29 popular main dishes, and 17 delectable desserts! Make just one to compliment your favorite dish, or make a whole meal!

Simply click on what you'd like to prepare -
  - A side dish
  - A main dish
  - A dessert
  - An entire meal - including the main dish, side, and a dessert.

Then click on **Let's Cook** and we'll generate a random option from our recipe selections!
